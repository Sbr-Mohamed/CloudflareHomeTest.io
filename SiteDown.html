       <Strong>Customer's ticket</Strong>" I am having trouble reaching my website http://example.com/ from different networks. Are your nameservers working <br>
        properly?"
    </p>
    <p>Dear Customer,</p>
    <p>Thank you for reaching out. I understand you are having trouble reaching your website <a href="http://example.com/">example.com</a> from different networks. Let's investigate this issue together.</p>

    <p>First, I have checked the status of our nameservers, and they are operational without any reported issues. Here are the steps you can follow to troubleshoot:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Check DNS Configuration:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure that the DNS records for your domain (<code>example.com</code>) are correctly configured within your Cloudflare account.</li>
                <li>Verify that the A, AAAA, CNAME, or other relevant records are pointing to the correct IP addresses or domain names of your server or hosting provider.</li>
            </ul>
        
        <li><strong>Verify Nameserver Settings</strong>
            <ul> 
                <li>Double-check that your domain is using Cloudflare's nameservers correctly. You can find your assigned Cloudflare nameservers in your Cloudflare account under the "DNS" section.</li>
                <li>Ensure that these nameservers are configured at your domain registrar where you purchased your domain</li>
            </ul>
        <li><strong>Use DNS Tools for Diagnosis:</strong>To verify DNS propagation and functionality, you can use tools like:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>dig command</strong>: A command-line tool for querying DNS name servers.</li>
                <li><strong>DNS Lookup Tools:</strong>Online tools such as MXToolbox or DNSstuff to check the current DNS records and propagation status of your domain.</li>
            </ul>
        
                <li><strong>Check Network Configuration:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sometimes, network issues specific to certain ISPs or regions can affect access to websites.</li>
                        <li>Test accessing your website from different networks and devices to see if the issue persists consistently.</li>
                    </ul>
    </ol>
        
                    
    <p>If the issue persists, please provide us with the specific error messages you are encountering and any recent changes made to your DNS settings.We are here to assist you further.</p>
