    <h1>Subject: Workers not applied</h1>
    <p><strong>Customer's Ticket</strong> "I've just added a Worker on the Cloudflare Dashboard for my website:
         it works in the debugger but doesn't work when I query the site. Why is that? Is there anything to activate or anything I could check?"</p>
    <p>Dear Customer,</p>
    <p>Thank you for reaching out to Cloudflare Support. I understand that you've added a Worker to your</p>
    <p>site, and while it works in the debugger, it doesn't seem to be functioning when you query your site</p>
    <p>directly. Let's troubleshoot this issue together.</p>
    <h1><strong>Steps to Ensure Your Worker is Applied Correctly</strong></h1>
    <ol>
            <li><strong>Worker Route Configuration:</strong></li>
<ul>
    <li>
        Ensure that your Worker is correctly mapped to the appropriate route(s).<br>
        In the Cloudflare Dashboard, go to Workers &gt; Manage Workers, and then check the routes specified for your Worker.<br>
        Make sure the URL pattern matches your site's URLs correctly.
      </li>
</ul>

    <li><strong>Script Activation:</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Verify that the Worker script is active. Under the Workers tab, check that your script is <br>
            enabled. You should see a toggle switch next to your script's name; it should be in the "on"<br>
            position.
        </li>
    </ul>
<li><strong>Domain Configuration:</strong></li>
 <ul>
    <li>
        Double-check that your domain is correctly set up in Cloudflare. Sometimes issues arise if  <br>
        the domain settings are not properly configured to use Cloudflare's proxy.
    </li>
 </ul>
  <li><strong>Cache Issues:</strong></li>
  <ul>
    <li>
        Sometimes, old cached data might interfere with the application of new Workers. Clear your  <br>
        site's cache in the Cloudflare Dashboard under Caching > Configuration > Purge <Cache. 
        You can choose to purge everything or specific files. </li>
  </ul>
  <li><strong>Error Logs and Debugging:</strong></li>
  <ul>
    <li>
        Check the error logs for any issues that might be preventing your Worker from running as <br>
        expected. In the Workers tab, click on your Worker, and then go to Logs to review any <br>
        errors or warnings.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li><strong>Propagation Time:</strong></li>
  <ul>
    <li>
        Occasionally, it might take a few minutes for changes to propagate fully. If you have just  <br>
        recently deployed your Worker, give it a little time and then check again.
    </li>
  </ul>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Additional Tips</strong></h2>
<li><strong>Service Bindings:</strong>
    If your Worker relies on any Service Bindings (such as KV storage or Durable <br>
       Objects), ensure these are properly configured and accessible.
</li>
<li><strong>Firewall Rules:</strong>
    Check if there are any firewall rules or security settings that might be blocking  <br>
    the Worker requests. Go to Firewall > Firewall Rules to review and adjust accordingly.
</li>
 
<p>If you've gone through these steps and your Worker still isn't functioning as expected, please <br>
    provide us with the following details so we can assist you further:
</p>
<li>The specific route or URL pattern the Worker is supposed to be applied to.</li>
<li>Any error messages you are seeing in the logs.</li>
<li>A brief description of what the Worker script is intended to do.</li>
<p>We are here to help and ensure your Worker operates smoothly. Thank you for choosing Cloudflare.</p>
