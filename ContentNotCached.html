    <h1>Subject: Content not Being Cached</h1>
    <p>Hello,</p>
   <p>
    Thank you for reaching out to us about these concerns. Based on the curl output you provided, it<br>
    appears that your site's resources are not being cached due to the Cache-Control headers set on <br>
    your origin server (Cloudflare-Nginx):
   </p>
   <u>
    <p>"Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0, max-age=0"</p>
   </u>
    <p>
        These headers instruct browsers and intermediaries (including Cloudflare) not to cache the content <br>
        (no-store, no-cache). This behavior can also be influenced by the sensitivity of your website's <br>
        content, such as for banking sites where caching sensitive information on the client side should be <br>
        avoided.
    </p>
   <p>To resolve this issue and optimize caching for your site, please follow these steps:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Update Cache-Control Headers: </strong>Modify the Cache-Control headers on your origin server <br>
        (Cloudflare-Nginx) to allow caching. Consider using headers like Cache-Control: public, max- <br>
        age=3600 to cache content for one hour, adjusting the max-age as needed.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Configure Page Rules in Cloudflare:</strong>Access your Cloudflare dashboard and navigate to the  <br>
        Page Rules section. Here, you can set specific caching rules tailored to your website's <br>
        requirements. You may want to enable a "Cache Everything" policy for appropriate content, <br>
        ensuring sensitive data is excluded from caching.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Purge Cache:</strong>After updating the headers and configuring Page Rules, purge Cloudflare's cache  <br>
        to ensure the changes take effect immediately. You can do this through the Cloudflare  <br>
        dashboard or API.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Further Assistance:</strong>If you encounter any difficulties or have questions about optimizing caching <br>
        settings or other Cloudflare services, please feel free to reach out to us. We're here to assist you <br>
        in maximizing your site's performance and security with Cloudflare.
